## Task 1: Create Resources with CloudFormation Stack Sets
1. Deploy required resources
2. Continue when both stack sets have successfully deployed


## Task 2: Create the table on the RDS Primary in us-east-1
1. Use AWS CloudShell to connect to the database in **us-east-1** using mysql:

```bash
mysql -h RDS-ENDPOINT -u admin -p
```
The password should-be "lab-password"

2. Configure the `sample` database

```sql
use sample;

show tables;
```

3. Create a table in the `sample` database

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (id INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, ordernumber VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, customername VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, address VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL, item VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```

4. Validate the orders tables exists

```sql
show tables;
```

5. Connect to the application using the DNS name of the ALB in us-east-1
6. Use the application one or more orders and then view the orders
7. View table contents (after adding orders through the app layer)

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders;
```

## Task 3: Test the web application in each region
1. Connect to the application using the DNS name of the ALB in **us-west-1**
2. Add an order and then view the order
3. Vaidate that all orders can be seen in the database


## Task 4: Create Route 53 Health Checks
1. Go to Route 53 > Health checks
2. Create a health check and set the name to `ALB-EAST`
3. Select to monitor an endpoint and specify by domain name
4. Set the "Domain name" to the DNS name of the ALB in **us-east-1**
5. Don't create an alarm, and complete the configuration
6. Repeat these steps for the ALB in **us-west-1** and name it `ALB-WEST`
7. Make a note of the ID of the ALB-EAST health check


## Task 5: Configure Route 53 Failover Routing Policies
1. Go to Route 53 > Hosted Zones and select your hosted zone
2. Create a record named `dr-lab`.  Enable "Alias" and select your ALB in **us-east-1**
3. Change the Routing policy to "Failover"
4. Select the ALB-EAST health check
5. Set the "Failover record type" and "Record ID" to "Primary"
6. Repeat these steps to create a similar record for your ALB in **us-west-1**, setting "Failover record type" and "Record ID" to "Secondary"
7. Connect to the application using the `dr-lab.<yourdomainname>` FQDN and view existing records.
8. On your local computer, use the nslookup command to see the ip addresses returned for the dr-lab FQDN. These should match the Public IPs of the Network Interfaces attached to your ALB in **us-east-1**


## Task 6: Automate updating the secret

### Create a Lambda function in the us-east-1 region to update the DB endpoint
1. Create a Lambda function named `UpdateSecret` with the Python 3.9 runtime and change the execution role to `DRLabLambdaRole`
2. Add the function code from the `UpdateSecret.py` file
3. Update the `new_db_endpoint` value in the code with the endpoint of the RDS Read Replica in the **us-west-1** region
4. Deploy the function

### Create a CloudWatch alarm
1. Go to CloudWatch and create an alarm
2. Select a metric and choose Route 53 > Health Check Metrics
3. Select the "HealthCheckStatus" metric that corresponds to the us-east-1 health check ID
4. Set the period to 1 minute
5. Use a static threshold, configure the "Lower" setting and set the value to "1"
6. Remove the default notification and add a Lambda action
7. Select the `UpdateSecret` Lambda function and give the same name to the Alarm
8. Record the ARN of the alarm

### Configure permissions to trigger the Lambda function
1. Using CloudShell, add a resource based policy to the Lambda function with the following CLI command, substituing your AWS account ID and the ARN of the `UpdateSecret` alarm

```bash
aws lambda add-permission --function-name UpdateSecret --statement-id AlarmAction --action 'lambda:InvokeFunction' --principal lambda.alarms.cloudwatch.amazonaws.com --source-account <AccountID> --source-arn <CloudWatch-Alarm-ARN>
```

## Task 7: Simulate failure and test failover

### Break the application layer
1. Remove the inbound HTTP rule from the ALB-SG in **us-east-1**
2. Watch the Route 53 Health Check and the CloudWatch alarm
3. Once the health check is unhealthy and the alarm is triggered the Lambda function should update the secret
4. Check the secret has been updated
5. On your local computer, use the nslookup command to see the ip addresses returned for the dr-lab FQDN. These should now match the Public IPs of the Network Interfaces attached to your ALB in **us-west-1**
6. Connect to the application and attempt to both view and create orders. You should be able to view but not create as the replica DB is read only

### Delete primary database and promote the read replica
1. Delete the primary RDS database in **us-east-1**
2. Promote the read replica in **us-west-1**
3. After the rds instance in **us-west-1** returns to the active state, return to the web application and confirm that you can create new orders
